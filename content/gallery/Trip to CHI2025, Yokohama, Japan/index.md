Attending **CHI 2025** in Yokohama, Japan, was an absolutely incredible experience – a perfect blend of diving deep into the latest Human-Computer Interaction research and exploring the captivating beauty of Japan. It was a week filled with inspiring talks, engaging discussions, and unforgettable cultural moments.


## The Conference Experience 🔬🤝

CHI 2025, as always, was a powerhouse of innovation and a fantastic platform for presenting cutting-edge research.

I had the honor of presenting our work, **"SandTouch: Empowering Virtual Sand Art in VR with AI Guidance and Emotional Relief,"** which was met with great interest and engaging questions. It was truly rewarding to share our findings and receive valuable feedback from the community.

The conference featured a diverse range of talks, from fundamental research to innovative applications. Listening to fellow researchers share their groundbreaking work was truly inspiring. I particularly enjoyed [mention a specific session/talk/topic if you wish, e.g., "the sessions on AI-Human Collaboration" or "connecting with researchers working on similar topics"]. Here's a glimpse of one of the engaging presentations:

## Exploring Yokohama's Charms 🌃🇯🇵

Beyond the conference halls, Yokohama proved to be a vibrant and charming city, offering a wonderful backdrop for unwinding and exploring. Its beautiful waterfront, modern architecture, and serene streets made for a delightful experience.

I took the chance to visit the **Nissan Gallery**, where cutting-edge automotive design meets an immersive brand experience. The displays were truly impressive!
