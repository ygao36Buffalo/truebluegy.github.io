abstract: Noninvasive sensors capable of measuring weak biopotential signals, such
  as electrocardiogram (ECG) and EEG, and communicating results wirelessly to a host
  computer are developing rapidly. Some of them utilize capacitively coupled electrodes
  in an attempt to place the sensor at a distance from the skin. This article demonstrated
  the fabrication and development of a capacitively coupled ECG electrode prototype
  using custom high specific capacitance electrodes and custom high-performance electronics.
  Two ultrathin capacitive electrodes were fabricated on a flexible polyimide substrate
  (2 Ã— 2 in) protected by a guard ring to reduce noise. The detection and amplification
  circuitry consisted of operational amplifiers (OpAmps) that filtered and conditioned
  the ECG signal. R-peaks in the ECG were readily detected and quantified using both
  simulated signals from ECG databases and real signals from human subjects. Heart
  rates and heart rate variability calculated from our monitor measurements were comparable
  with commercial rigid wearable sensors, including a smartwatch and an ECG monitor
  that uses standard clinical ionic electrodes. The prototype monitor was tested on
  human subjects during rest and moderate exercise and showed appropriate responses.
  The challenge of high-gain low-noise amplification was met by the development of
  highly thinned OpAmps whose operation was shown to be equivalent to commercially
  available rigidly packaged OpAmps, demonstrating that high-performance Si-electronics
  can be used to produce high-fidelity signals from weak biopotentials.
