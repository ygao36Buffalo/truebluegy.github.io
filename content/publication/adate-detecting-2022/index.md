abstract: Screen time is associated with several health risk behaviors including mindless
  eating, sedentary behavior, and decreased academic performance. Screen time behavior
  is traditionally assessed with self-report measures, which are known to be burdensome,
  inaccurate, and imprecise. Recent methods to automatically detect screen time are
  geared more towards detecting television screens from wearable cameras that record
  high-resolution video. Activity-oriented wearable cameras (i.e., cameras oriented
  towards the wearer with a fisheye lens) have recently been designed and shown to
  reduce privacy concerns, yet pose a greater challenge in capturing screens due to
  their orientation and fewer pixels on target. Methods that detect screens from low-power,
  low-resolution wearable camera video are needed given the increased adoption of
  such devices in longitudinal studies. We propose a method that leverages deep learning
  algorithms and lower-resolution images from an activity-oriented camera to detect
  screen presence from multiple types of screens with high variability of pixel on
  target (e.g., near and far TV, smartphones, laptops, and tablets). We test our system
  in a real-world study comprising 10 individuals, 80 hours of data, and 1.2 million
  low-resolution RGB frames. Our results outperform existing state-of-the-art video
  screen detection methods yielding an F1-score of 81%. This paper demonstrates the
  potential for detecting screen-watching behavior in longitudinal studies using activity-oriented
  cameras, paving the way for a nuanced understanding of screen timeâ€™s relationship
  with health risk behaviors.
