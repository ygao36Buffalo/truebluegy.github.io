abstract: 'The accurate assessment of human body posture through wearable technology
  has significant implications for sports science, clinical diagnostics, rehabilitation,
  and VR interaction. Traditional methods often require complex setups or are limited
  by the environment’s constraints. In response to these challenges, this paper presents
  an innovative approach to human posture estimation under complex motion scenarios
  through the development of an advanced shoe insole embedded with pressure sensors
  and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Coupled with a single wrist-mounted IMU,
  our system facilitates a comprehensive analysis of human biomechanics by integrating
  physical kinematics modeling based on pressure data with a multi-region human posture
  estimation network. To enhance the robustness of our system model, we employed large
  language models to generate virtual human motion sequences. These sequences were
  utilized to create synthetic IMU data for data augmentation purposes, addressing
  the challenge of limited real-world data availability and variability. Our approach
  uniquely combines physical modeling with data-driven techniques to improve the accuracy
  and reliability of posture estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
  integrated system significantly advances wearable technology for motion analysis.
  The Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) was reduced to 7.75 cm, highlighting the
  effectiveness of our multi-modal modeling and virtual data augmentation in refining
  posture estimation. CCS Concepts: • Human-centered computing → Human computer interaction
  (HCI); Ubiquitous and mobile computing systems and tools.'
