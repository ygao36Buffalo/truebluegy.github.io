abstract: Hand pose tracking is essential for advancing applications in humancomputer
  interaction. Current approaches, such as vision-based systems and wearable devices,
  face limitations in portability, usability, and practicality. This paper proposes
  a novel multimodal hand pose tracking framework that integrates data from an IMU-equipped
  ring and EMG sensors embedded in a wrist-worn device. By leveraging the complementary
  strengths of motion dynamics and muscle activity, our deep learning-based sensor
  fusion approach achieves precise 3D hand pose reconstruction. We fused multichannel
  data using a transformer-based model incorporating time encoding and cross-modal
  attention mechanisms. We also designed weighted loss function designed to optimize
  spatial, kinematic, and anatomical accuracy. Experimental validation using a custom
  dataset of 19 gestures performed by 10 participants demonstrates robust performance,
  with an average MPJPE of 0.750 cm and joint angle differences of 6.815Â° for cross-user
  evaluation.
