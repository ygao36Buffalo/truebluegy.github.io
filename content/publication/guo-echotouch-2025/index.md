abstract: Accurately recognizing face-touching behavior at any time and place can
  help prevent potential health risks and improve personal habits. However, there
  remains a lack of effective methods that can be applied in real-world scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose EchoTouch, a low-power, unobtrusive active acoustic sensing
  system for monitoring face-touching behavior. EchoTouch captures features from both
  sides of the face by emitting and receiving orthogonal ultrasound signals through
  two pairs of microphones and speakers mounted along the under frame of glasses.
  Then, a lightweight and multi-task deep learning framework identifies the touch
  area and determines whether the behavior is intrusive to prevent such actions. Finally,
  a two-stage irrelevant action filtering mechanism effectively handles various interferences.
  We evaluate EchoTouch on 20 individuals using 11 different types of face-touching
  areas. EchoTouch achieves an average accuracy of 92.9%, with an 87.2% accuracy in
  determining whether the behavior is intrusive. Additionally, in-the-wild evaluations
  further validate the robustness of EchoTouch. We believe that EchoTouch can serve
  as an unobtrusive and reliable way to monitor and prevent intrusive face-touching
  behavior.
