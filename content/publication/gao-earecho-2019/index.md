abstract: Smart wearable devices have recently become one of the major technological
  trends and been widely adopted by the general public. Wireless earphones, in particular,
  have seen a skyrocketing growth due to its great usability and convenience. With
  the goal of seeking a more unobtrusive wearable authentication method that the users
  can easily use and conveniently access, in this study we present EarEcho as a novel,
  affordable, user-friendly biometric authentication solution. EarEcho takes advantages
  of the unique physical and geometrical characteristics of human ear canal and assesses
  the content-free acoustic features of in-ear sound waves for user authentication
  in a wearable and mobile manner. We implemented the proposed EarEcho on a proof-of-concept
  prototype and tested it among 20 subjects under diverse application scenarios. We
  can achieve a recall of 94.19% and precision of 95.16% for one-time authentication,
  while a recall of 97.55% and precision of 97.57% for continuous authentication.
  EarEcho has demonstrated its stability over time and robustness to cope with the
  uncertainties on the varying background noises, body motions, and sound pressure
  levels.
