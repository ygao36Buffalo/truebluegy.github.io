abstract: Sign language builds up an important bridge between the d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing
  (DHH) and hearing people. Regrettably, most hearing people face challenges in comprehending
  sign language, necessitating sign language translation. However, state-of-the-art
  wearable-based techniques mainly concentrate on recognizing manual markers (e.g.,
  hand gestures), while frequently overlooking non-manual markers, such as negative
  head shaking, question markers, and mouthing. This oversight results in the loss
  of substantial grammatical and semantic information in sign language. To address
  this limitation, we introduce SmartASL, a novel proof-of-concept system that can
  1) recognize both manual and non-manual markers simultaneously using a combination
  of earbuds and a wrist-worn IMU, and 2) translate the recognized American Sign Language
  (ASL) glosses into spoken language. Our experiments demonstrate the SmartASL system's
  significant potential to accurately recognize the manual and non-manual markers
  in ASL, effectively bridging the communication gaps between ASL signers and hearing
  people using commercially available devices.
