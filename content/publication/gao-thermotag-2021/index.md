abstract: To address the increasing challenges of counterfeit detection and IP protection
  for 3D printing, we propose that every 3D printer holds unique fingerprinting features
  characterized by the thermodynamic properties of the extruder hot-end and can be
  used as a new way of 3D watermarking. We prove that these physical fingerprints
  resulting from manufacturing imperfections and system variations exhibit distinct
  heating responses, namely “ThermoTag,” which can be represented as the distinguishable
  thermodynamic processes and, ultimately, the temperature readings during the preheating
  process. Experimental results show that, by only changing the hot-ends of the same
  model on the same 3D printer, we can achieve about 92% identification accuracy amongst
  45 hot-ends. The permanence and robustness of ThermoTag for the same hot-end were
  examined, throughout a period of one month with hundreds of trials under different
  environmental temperature settings. Leveraging the hidden ThermoTag, an example
  of watermarking scheme in 3D printing is presented and evaluated.
