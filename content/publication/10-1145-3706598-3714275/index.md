abstract: Sand painting is a highly aesthetic and valuable form of art but often constrained
  by the need for specific equipment and the associated learning curve. To address
  these challenges, we developed a VR sand painting system, SandTouch, offering an
  immersive and intuitive sand painting experience that closely mirrors the interaction
  with physical sand. Leveraging advanced gesture recognition technology, SandTouch
  allows users to create intricate sand art in a virtual environment, capturing the
  fine sensations of real sand manipulation along with realistic sound feedback. The
  integration of AI agent further enhances the experience by intelligently interpreting
  usersâ€™ creative intentions based on real-time interactions, offering contextually
  relevant artistic suggestions. Comprehensive evaluations have demonstrated a significant
  increase in user engagement and immersion. Furthermore, the realistic sound feedback
  enhances emotional relief and deepens the painting experience.
