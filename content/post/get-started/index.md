## Overview

1. The Hugo Blox website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more



## Themes

Hugo Blox and its templates come with **automatic day (light) and night (dark) mode** built-in. Visitors can choose their preferred mode by clicking the sun/moon icon in the header.

[Choose a stunning **theme** and **font**](https://docs.hugoblox.com/getting-started/customize/) for your site. Themes are fully customizable.
